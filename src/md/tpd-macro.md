General Architecture

---
I was given a general description of an architecture, with a minimal set of
functional requirements, and conditions about the degree of implementation of
characteristics such as logging, testing, and metrics collection.

I was also given a base repository with most of the setup already done with
Docker Compose. But since we had freedom to add more tools at our discretion, 
I decided to start from scratch on Kubernetes. Everything you will find in the 
repository, except only for the frontend server (which I will replace eventually),
is built and managed by me. This may imply _a lot_ of questionable decisions.
